### Project Description: End-to-End Chatbot using LangChain, LLaMA, and Streamlit

---

**Project Title**: End-to-End Chatbot Development

**Developer**: Subhrajyoti Mandal

**Overview**:
This project is an end-to-end chatbot application developed using the LangChain framework, the LLaMA language model, and Streamlit for the web interface. The chatbot is designed to run locally on a MacBook and serves as a demonstration of building conversational AI systems leveraging state-of-the-art language models.

**Key Features**:

- **LangChain Integration**: Utilizes the LangChain framework to manage interactions with the language model and streamline the development process.
- **LLaMA Model**: Incorporates the LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI) from Hugging Faceâ€™s Transformers library, providing superior conversational capabilities compared to smaller models like GPT-2.
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Streamlit is used to create an intuitive and responsive web interface, allowing users to interact with the chatbot in real-time.
- **Local Deployment**: The entire application is designed to run locally, making it easy to demonstrate and modify without relying on external servers.

**Technologies Used**:

- **Python**: The core programming language for the project.
- **LangChain**: Framework for building applications powered by language models.
- **LLaMA (via Hugging Face)**: A powerful language model used for generating responses.
- **Streamlit**: A Python library for creating web applications, used to build the chatbot's interface.
- **SentencePiece**: Tokenization library required by LLaMA.

**Installation and Setup**:

- The project includes a `requirements.txt` file for easy installation of dependencies.
- The application can be launched with a simple `streamlit run chatbot/main.py` command.

**Purpose**:
This project serves as a practical example for learning and demonstrating the process of building a conversational AI system. It can be used for educational purposes, personal projects, or as a foundation for more complex AI applications.

**Author**:
Subhrajyoti Mandal, an AI enthusiast and developer with experience in natural language processing and machine learning.

**Future Enhancements**:

- **Contextual Memory**: Implementing a memory component to enable the chatbot to retain context across multiple interactions.
- **Model Fine-Tuning**: Fine-tuning the LLaMA model on custom datasets for more specific use cases.
- **Deployment**: Extending the project for deployment on cloud platforms such as AWS or Heroku to make the chatbot accessible online.
